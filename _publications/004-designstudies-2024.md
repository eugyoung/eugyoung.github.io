<b>Abstract:</b> Virtual Reality (VR) is an emerging medium with consequences for studying design processes. In VR, users can design using direct manipulation and move both by walking and using their hands in the physical world and beyond physical spaces using abstract movement such as teleportation. However, research examining VR design processes remains limited.

In this work, we present a large-scale analysis of 730 VR designs from 254 students. We built models of VR design processes, selecting features based on previous theoretical and empirical research. By examining these models at scale, we analyzed design behaviors and their relationship with the context and final design. This research provides a tool for describing VR design processes and highlights broader implications for designers and educators.
