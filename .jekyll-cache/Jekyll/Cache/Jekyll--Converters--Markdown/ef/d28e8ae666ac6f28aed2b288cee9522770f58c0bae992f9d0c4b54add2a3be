I"Ô<p>Hi! My name is Eugy and I am currently a 4th year Ph.D. candidate at Stanford University. I am advised by <a href="https://vhil.stanford.edu/people/jeremy-bailenson">Professor Jeremy Bailenson</a> at the <a href="https://vhil.stanford.edu/">Virtual Human Interaction Lab</a> at Stanford University. Prior to Stanford, I received my B.S. in Cognitive Science at Brown University, under the supervision of <a href="https://www.brown.edu/academics/cognitive-linguistic-psychological-sciences/people/faculty/william-warren">Professor William Warren</a>.</p>

<p>My research focuses on spatial context (physical and virtual) and social context and how they influence psychological and behavioral outcomes during social interactions in VR/MR. Ultimately, I am interested in how these findings can shape virtual practices in domains such as law and education.</p>

<p>In my free time, I enjoy reading/writing sci-fi short stories, exploring coffee shops, and enjoying sunny days.</p>
