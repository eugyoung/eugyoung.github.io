Hi there! I am a second-year master's student studying MS&E at Stanford University. I graduated from Columbia University with a B.S. in Computer Science and a minor in Applied Mathematics.

I am broadly interested in the intersection of <a href='#'> Augmented/Virtual Reality</a>,  <a href='#'>Art/Design</a>, and  <a href='#'>the Social Sciences</a>. My current research focuses on developing algorithms and tools to understand and facilitate human behavior such as social interactions and the creative design process in immersive virtual environments.

While at Columbia, I worked as a research assistant advised by <a href='http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~feiner/'>Professor Steven Feiner</a> at the <a href='https://graphics.cs.columbia.edu/home'> Computer Graphics and User Interfaces Lab.

I currently work as a research assistant advised by Professor Jeremy Bailenson at the<a href='https://vhil.stanford.edu/'> Virtual Human Interaction Lab</a> at Stanford University. My research is supported by the Sozo Graduate Fellowship.
