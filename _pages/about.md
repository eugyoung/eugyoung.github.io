Hi! My name is Eugy and I am currently a 4th year Ph.D. candidate at Stanford University. I am advised by Professor Jeremy Bailenson at the Virtual Human Interaction Lab at Stanford University. Prior to Stanford, I received my B.S. in Cognitive Science at Brown University, under the supervision of Professor William Warren.

My research focuses on contexts and understanding how where you are (physically and virtually) and who you are with influence your cognitive and behavioral responses during social interactions in VR/MR. How do factors such as your virtual appearance and your surroundings influence the way you perceive and move in the virtual world? Ultimately, I am interested in how these findings can shape virtual practices in domains such as law and education. My most recent project involves a longitudinal, large-scale examination of social interactions.
