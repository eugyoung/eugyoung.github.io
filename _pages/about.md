Hi, I'm Eugy (pronounced oo-ghee), a 5th year Ph.D. candidate at Stanford University. I'm advised by Professor Jeremy N. Bailenson at the [Virtual Human Interaction Lab](https://vhil.stanford.edu/) at Stanford University. Prior to Stanford, I was advised by Professor William H. Warren at the [Virtual Environment Navigation Lab](https://sites.brown.edu/venlab/about/) at Brown University, where I also received my B.S. in Cognitive Science. 

My research focuses on understanding what social interactions look like in immersive virtual environments, such as virtual and mixed reality. Specifically, I investigate __how contextual factors — physical, virtual, and social — influence these interactions__. I conduct large-scale, longitudinal studies to understand outcomes such as nonverbal behaviors and psychological processes. My work related to this has been covered by [VentureBeat](https://venturebeat.com/games/vr-study-shows-virtual-avatars-and-environments-can-affect-your-mood/) and [Stanford News](https://news.stanford.edu/2022/12/14/vr-real-impact-study-finds/#).

Another thread of my research focuses on __how we can integrate immersive technologies in sustainable and equitable ways into education__. My work related to this has been covered by [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/27/tech/vr-classes/index.html) and [Stanford News](https://news.stanford.edu/stories/2021/11/new-class-among-first-taught-entirely-virtual-reality). 


I am on the academic job market for the 2024-2025 cycle!
