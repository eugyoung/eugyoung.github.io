Hi! My name is Eugy and I am currently a 4th year Ph.D. candidate at Stanford University. I am advised by [Professor Jeremy Bailenson](https://vhil.stanford.edu/people/jeremy-bailenson) at the [Virtual Human Interaction Lab](https://vhil.stanford.edu/) at Stanford University. Prior to Stanford, I received my B.S. in Cognitive Science at Brown University, under the supervision of [Professor William Warren](https://www.brown.edu/academics/cognitive-linguistic-psychological-sciences/people/faculty/william-warren).

My research focuses on spatial context (physical and virtual) and social context and how they influence psychological and behavioral outcomes during social interactions in VR/MR. Ultimately, I am interested in how these findings can shape virtual practices in domains such as law and education. 

In my free time, I enjoy reading/writing sci-fi short stories, exploring coffee shops, and enjoying sunny days.
